A simple concrete number parser written in Rust.

## What's a concrete number?
A concrete number is a number associated with the thing it's counting. Here I'm using it to mean a combination of a numerical quantity and a physical unitâ€”for example, "3 metres", or "12 Newtons".

## Goals:
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide concrete numbers
- Perform unit conversion 

## Todo:

- [x] Model concrete numbers
- [x] Write lexer to convert string inputs into concrete numbers
- [ ] Write parser to evaluate math expressions and output result, including unit conversion
- [ ] Process SI prefixes
